# DCGAN
This repository hosts an implementation of a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) tailored specifically for generating unique Pokémon images. With this model, explore the world of Pokémon through AI-generated creations.


Features:

1. Diverse Pokémon Generation
Generate a diverse range of Pokémon images leveraging the power of DCGAN. From classic favorites to entirely new and imaginative creatures, witness the AI's creativity.

2. Customizable Generation
Fine-tune the generation process by adjusting hyperparameters and training settings. Experiment with different configurations to yield unique Pokémon designs.

3. Transfer Learning
Utilize transfer learning techniques to incorporate specific traits or characteristics from existing Pokémon, allowing the model to learn and generate Pokémon with desired attributes.

4. Interactive Interface
A user-friendly interface to interact with the model, enabling seamless generation of Pokémon images and exploration of the generated dataset.

5. Evaluation Metrics
Assess the quality of generated Pokémon using various evaluation metrics such as Inception Score, Frechet Inception Distance (FID), and more.

How to Use:
Dataset Preparation: Obtain the Pokémon dataset or use preprocessed data to train the DCGAN model.
Training: Train the model by running the provided scripts or notebooks, adjusting parameters as needed.
Generation: Generate Pokémon images using the trained model and explore the diverse set of outputs.
Fine-tuning: Experiment with different settings and techniques to enhance or customize the generated Pokémon.
